## [Unreleased]

## [2.36.1] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Conditional branch fan-out detection** (`CONDITIONAL_BRANCH_FANOUT`): Warns when IF, Filter, or Switch nodes have all connections crammed into `main[0]` with higher-index outputs empty, which usually means all target nodes execute together on one branch while other branches have no effect
  - Detects IF nodes with both true/false targets on `main[0]`
  - Detects Filter nodes with both matched/unmatched targets on `main[0]`
  - Detects Switch nodes with all targets on output 0 and other outputs unused
  - Skips warning when fan-out is legitimate (higher outputs also have connections)
  - Skips warning for single connections (intentional true-only/matched-only usage)

### Changed

- **Refactored output index validation**: Extracted `getShortNodeType()` and `getConditionalOutputInfo()` helpers to eliminate duplicated conditional node detection logic between `validateOutputIndexBounds` and the new `validateConditionalBranchUsage`

## [2.36.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Connection validation: detect broken/malformed workflow connections** (Issue #620):
  - Unknown output keys (`UNKNOWN_CONNECTION_KEY`): Flags invalid connection keys like `"0"`, `"1"`, `"output"` with fix suggestions (e.g., "use main[1] instead" for numeric keys)
  - Invalid type field (`INVALID_CONNECTION_TYPE`): Detects invalid `type` values in connection targets (e.g., `"0"` instead of `"main"`)
  - Output index bounds checking (`OUTPUT_INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUNDS`): Catches connections using output indices beyond what a node supports, with awareness of `onError: 'continueErrorOutput'`, Switch rules, and IF/Filter nodes
  - Input index bounds checking (`INPUT_INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUNDS`): Validates target input indices against known node input counts (Merge=2, triggers=0, others=1)
  - BFS-based trigger reachability analysis: Replaces simple orphan detection with proper graph traversal from trigger nodes, flagging unreachable subgraphs
  - Flexible `WorkflowConnection` interface: Changed from explicit `main?/error?/ai_tool?` to `[outputType: string]` for accurate validation of all connection types

## [2.35.6] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- **Updated n8n dependencies**: n8n 2.8.3 → 2.10.3, n8n-core 2.8.1 → 2.10.1, n8n-workflow 2.8.0 → 2.10.1, @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain 2.8.1 → 2.10.1
- Rebuilt node database with 806 core nodes (community nodes preserved from previous build)

## [2.35.5] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **Comprehensive parameter type coercion for Claude Desktop / Claude.ai** (Issue #605): Expanded the v2.35.4 fix to handle ALL type mismatches, not just stringified objects/arrays. Testing revealed 6/9 tools still failing in Claude Desktop after the initial fix.
  - Extended `coerceStringifiedJsonParams()` to coerce every schema type: `string→number`, `string→boolean`, `number→string`, `boolean→string` (in addition to existing `string→object` and `string→array`)
  - Added top-level safeguard to parse the entire `args` object if it arrives as a JSON string
  - Added `[Diagnostic]` section to error responses showing received argument types, enabling users to report exactly what their MCP client sends
  - Added 9 new unit tests (24 total) covering number, boolean, and number-to-string coercion

Conceived by Romuald Czlonkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.35.4] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **Defensive JSON.parse for stringified object/array parameters** (Issue #605): Claude Desktop 1.1.3189 serializes JSON object/array MCP parameters as strings, causing ZodError failures for ~60% of tools that accept nested parameters
  - Added schema-driven `coerceStringifiedJsonParams()` in the central `CallToolRequestSchema` handler
  - Automatically detects string values where the tool's `inputSchema` expects `object` or `array`, and parses them back
  - Safe: prefix check before parsing, type verification after, try/catch preserves original on failure
  - No-op for correct clients: native objects pass through unchanged
  - Affects 9 tools with object/array params: `validate_node`, `validate_workflow`, `n8n_create_workflow`, `n8n_update_full_workflow`, `n8n_update_partial_workflow`, `n8n_validate_workflow`, `n8n_autofix_workflow`, `n8n_test_workflow`, `n8n_executions`
  - Added 15 unit tests covering coercion, no-op, safety, and end-to-end scenarios

## [2.35.3] - 2026-02-19

### Changed

- **Updated n8n dependencies**: n8n 2.6.3 → 2.8.3, n8n-core 2.6.1 → 2.8.1, n8n-workflow 2.6.0 → 2.8.0, @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain 2.6.2 → 2.8.1
- **Fixed node loader for langchain package**: Adapted node loader to bypass restricted package.json `exports` field in @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain >=2.9.0, resolving node files via absolute paths instead of `require.resolve()`
- **Fixed community doc generation for cloud LLMs**: Added `N8N_MCP_LLM_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_KEY` env var support, switched to `max_completion_tokens`, and auto-omit `temperature` for cloud API endpoints
- Rebuilt node database with 1,236 nodes (673 from n8n-nodes-base, 133 from @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain, 430 community)
- Refreshed community nodes (361 verified + 69 npm) with 424/430 AI documentation summaries

## [2.35.2] - 2026-02-09

### Changed

- **MCP Apps: Disable non-rendering apps in Claude.ai**: Disabled 3 MCP Apps (workflow-list, execution-history, health-dashboard) that render as collapsed accordions in Claude.ai, and removed `n8n_deploy_template` tool mapping which renders blank content. The server sets `_meta` correctly on the wire but the Claude.ai host ignores it for these tools. The 2 working apps (operation-result for 6 tools, validation-summary for 3 tools) remain active. Disabled apps can be re-enabled once the host-side issue is resolved.

Conceived by Romuald Czlonkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.35.1] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **MCP Apps: Fix UI not rendering for some tools in Claude**: Added legacy flat `_meta["ui/resourceUri"]` key alongside the nested `_meta.ui.resourceUri` in tool definitions. Claude.ai reads the flat key format; without it, tools like `n8n_health_check` and `n8n_list_workflows` showed as collapsed accordions instead of rendering their rich UI apps. Both key formats are now set by `injectToolMeta()`, matching the behavior of the official `registerAppTool` helper from `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/server`.

Conceived by Romuald Czlonkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.35.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **3 new MCP Apps**: workflow-list (compact table with status/tags), execution-history (status summary bar + execution table), health-dashboard (connection status, versions, performance metrics)
- **Enhanced operation-result**: operation-aware headers (create/update/delete/test/deploy), detail panels with workflow metadata, copy-to-clipboard for IDs/URLs, autofix diff viewer
- **CopyButton shared component**: reusable clipboard button with visual feedback
- **Local preview harness** (`ui-apps/preview.html`): test all 5 apps with mock data, dark/light theme toggle, JSON-RPC protocol simulation
- **Expanded shared types**: TypeScript types for workflow-list, execution-history, and health-dashboard data

### Fixed

- **React hooks violation**: Fixed `useMemo` called after early returns in `execution-history/App.tsx` and `validation-summary/App.tsx`, causing React error #310 ("Rendered more hooks than during the previous render") and blank iframes
- **JSON-RPC catch-all handler**: Preview harness responds to unknown SDK requests to prevent hangs

## [2.34.5] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **MCP Apps: Fix blank UI and wrong status badge in Claude**: Rewrote `useToolData` hook to use the official `useApp` hook from `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/react` for proper lifecycle management. Updated UI types and components to match actual server response format (`success: boolean` instead of `status: string`, nested `data` object for workflow details). Validation summary now handles both direct and wrapped (`n8n_validate_workflow`) response shapes.

Conceived by Romuald Czlonkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.34.3] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **MCP Apps: Use correct MIME type for ext-apps spec**: Changed resource MIME type from `text/html` to `text/html;profile=mcp-app` (the `RESOURCE_MIME_TYPE` constant from `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`). Without this profile parameter, Claude Desktop/web fails to recognize resources as MCP Apps and shows "Failed to load MCP App: the resource may exceed the 5 MB size limit."

Conceived by Romuald Czlonkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.34.2] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **CI: UI apps missing from npm package**: Release pipeline only ran `npm run build` (TypeScript), so `ui-apps/dist/` was never built and excluded from published packages
  - Changed build step to `npm run build:all` in `build-and-verify` and `publish-npm` jobs
  - Added `ui-apps/dist/` to npm publish staging directory
  - Added `ui-apps/dist/**/*` to published package files list

Conceived by Romuald Czlonkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.34.1] - 2026-02-07

### Changed

- **MCP Apps: Align with official ext-apps spec** for Claude Desktop/web compatibility
  - URI scheme changed from `n8n-mcp://ui/{id}` to `ui://n8n-mcp/{id}` per MCP ext-apps spec
  - `_meta.ui.resourceUri` now set on tool definitions (`tools/list`) instead of tool call responses
  - `UIMetadata.ui.app` renamed to `UIMetadata.ui.resourceUri`
  - Added `_meta` field to `ToolDefinition` type
  - Added `UIAppRegistry.injectToolMeta()` method for enriching tool definitions
  - UI apps now use `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` `App` class instead of `window.__MCP_DATA__`
  - Updated `ReadResource` URI parser to match new `ui://` scheme

Conceived by Romuald Czlonkowski - https://www.aiadvisors.pl/en

## [2.34.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **MCP Apps**: Rich HTML UIs rendered by MCP hosts alongside tool results via `_meta.ui` and the MCP resources protocol
  - Server-side UI module (`src/mcp/ui/`) with tool-to-UI mapping and `_meta.ui` injection
  - `UIAppRegistry` static class for loading and serving self-contained HTML apps
  - `UI_APP_CONFIGS` mapping tools to their corresponding UI apps

- **Operation Result UI**: Visual summary for workflow operation tools
  - Status badge, operation type, workflow details card
  - Expandable sections for nodes added, modified, and removed
  - Mapped to: `n8n_create_workflow`, `n8n_update_full_workflow`, `n8n_update_partial_workflow`, `n8n_delete_workflow`, `n8n_test_workflow`, `n8n_autofix_workflow`, `n8n_deploy_template`

- **Validation Summary UI**: Visual summary for validation tools
  - Valid/invalid badge with error and warning counts
  - Expandable error list with type, property, message, and fix
  - Expandable warning list and suggestions
  - Mapped to: `validate_node`, `validate_workflow`, `n8n_validate_workflow`

- **React + Vite Build Pipeline** (`ui-apps/`):
  - React 19, Vite 6, vite-plugin-singlefile for self-contained HTML output
  - Shared component library: Card, Badge, Expandable
  - `useToolData` hook for reading data from `window.__MCP_DATA__` or embedded JSON
  - n8n-branded dark theme with CSS custom properties
  - Per-app builds via `APP_NAME` environment variable

- **MCP Resources Protocol**: Server now exposes `resources` capability
  - `ListResources` handler returns available UI apps
  - `ReadResource` handler serves self-contained HTML via `n8n-mcp://ui/{id}` URIs

- **New Scripts**:
  - `build:ui`: Build UI apps (`cd ui-apps && npm install && npm run build`)
  - `build:all`: Build UI apps then server (`npm run build:ui && npm run build`)

### Changed

- **MCP Server**: Added `resources: {}` to server capabilities alongside existing `tools: {}`
- **Tool Responses**: Tools with matching UI apps now include `_meta.ui.app` URI pointing to their visual representation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Server starts and operates normally without `ui-apps/dist/`; UI metadata is only injected when HTML is available

## [2.33.6] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- Updated n8n from 2.4.4 to 2.6.3
- Updated n8n-core from 2.4.2 to 2.6.1
- Updated n8n-workflow from 2.4.2 to 2.6.0
- Updated @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain from 2.4.3 to 2.6.2

- Updated README badge with new n8n version

## [2.33.5] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **Critical memory leak: per-session database connections** (Issue #542): Fixed severe memory leak where each MCP session created its own database connection (~900MB per session)
  - Root cause: `N8NDocumentationMCPServer` called `createDatabaseAdapter()` for every new session, duplicating the entire 68MB database in memory
  - With 3-4 sessions, memory would exceed 4GB causing OOM kills every ~20 minutes
  - Fix: Implemented singleton `SharedDatabase` pattern - all sessions now share ONE database connection
  - Memory impact: Reduced from ~900MB per session to ~68MB total (shared) + ~5MB per session overhead
  - Added `getSharedDatabase()` and `releaseSharedDatabase()` for thread-safe connection management
  - Added reference counting to track active sessions using the shared connection

- **Session timeout optimization**: Reduced default session timeout from 30 minutes to 5 minutes
  - Faster cleanup of stale sessions reduces memory buildup
  - Configurable via `SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` environment variable

- **Eager instance cleanup**: When a client reconnects, previous sessions for the same instanceId are now immediately cleaned up
  - Prevents memory accumulation from reconnecting clients in multi-tenant deployments

- **Telemetry event listener leak**: Fixed event listeners in `TelemetryBatchProcessor` that were never removed
  - Added proper cleanup in `stop()` method
  - Added guard against multiple `start()` calls

### Added

- **New module: `src/database/shared-database.ts`** - Singleton database manager
  - `getSharedDatabase(dbPath)`: Thread-safe initialization with promise lock pattern
  - `releaseSharedDatabase(state)`: Reference counting for cleanup
  - `closeSharedDatabase()`: Graceful shutdown for process termination
  - `isSharedDatabaseInitialized()` and `getSharedDatabaseRefCount()`: Monitoring helpers

### Changed

- **`N8NDocumentationMCPServer.close()`**: Now releases shared database reference instead of closing the connection
- **`SingleSessionHTTPServer.shutdown()`**: Calls `closeSharedDatabase()` during graceful shutdown

## [2.33.4] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **Memory leak in SSE session reset** (Issue #542): Fixed memory leak when SSE sessions are recreated every 5 minutes
  - Root cause: `resetSessionSSE()` only closed the transport but not the MCP server
  - This left the SimpleCache cleanup timer (60-second interval) running indefinitely
  - Database connections and cached data (~50-100MB per session) persisted in memory
  - Fix: Added `server.close()` call before `transport.close()`, mirroring the existing cleanup pattern in `removeSession()`
  - Impact: Prevents ~288 leaked server instances per day in long-running HTTP deployments

## [2.33.3] - 2026-01-21

### Changed

- **Updated n8n dependencies to latest versions**
  - n8n: 2.3.3 → 2.4.4
  - n8n-core: 2.3.2 → 2.4.2
  - n8n-workflow: 2.3.2 → 2.4.2
  - @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain: 2.3.2 → 2.4.3

### Added

- **New `icon` property type**: Added support for the new `icon` NodePropertyType introduced in n8n 2.4.x
  - Added type structure definition in `src/constants/type-structures.ts`
  - Updated type count from 22 to 23 NodePropertyTypes
  - Updated related tests to reflect the new type

### Fixed

- Rebuilt node database with 803 nodes (541 from n8n-nodes-base, 262 from @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain)

## [2.33.2] - 2026-01-13

### Changed

- **Updated n8n dependencies to latest versions**
  - n8n: 2.2.3 → 2.3.3
  - n8n-core: 2.2.2 → 2.3.2
  - n8n-workflow: 2.2.2 → 2.3.2
  - @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain: 2.2.2 → 2.3.2
  - Rebuilt node database with 537 nodes (434 from n8n-nodes-base, 103 from @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain)
  - Updated README badge with new n8n version

## [2.33.1] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed

- **Docker image version mismatch bug**: Docker images were built with stale `package.runtime.json` (v2.29.5) while npm package was at v2.33.0
  - Root cause: `build-docker` job in `release.yml` did not sync `package.runtime.json` version before building
  - The `publish-npm` job synced the version, but both jobs ran in parallel, so Docker got the stale version
  - Added "Sync runtime version" step to `release.yml` `build-docker` job
  - Added "Sync runtime version" step to `docker-build.yml` `build` and `build-railway` jobs
  - All Docker builds now sync `package.runtime.json` version from `package.json` before building

## [2.33.0] - 2026-01-08
